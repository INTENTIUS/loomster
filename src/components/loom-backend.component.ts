/**
 * The `loom-backend` service (chant#889) — build (`docker-build` ->
 * archive) -> publish (`publish-image`, promote by digest) -> apply
 * (`cfn-deploy`), with a `rollback-previous` compensation phase. The
 * template is what `chant build src/loom-backend --lexicon aws`
 * synthesizes from `../composites/loom-backend.ts`. No separate
 * `ecs-update-service` step, and no Verify phase, unlike the reference
 * preset this mirrors — see the Apply phase's own comment for why
 * (chant#928/loomster#35).
 *
 * **Docker build context.** Loom's application source (the `backend/`
 * directory + its `Dockerfile`) is not vendored into this repo — it lives
 * upstream at `awslabs/loom` (pinned `v1.6.0`). `npm run vendor`
 * (`scripts/vendor-loom.sh`) fetches it into `vendor/loom` (gitignored)
 * before running a real deploy; `context`/`dockerfile` below assume that
 * layout. None of this component's gates (typecheck/lint/test/synth/`chant
 * graph --components`) touch the filesystem at this path — only an actual
 * `chant run` does.
 *
 * **Context is the vendor root, not `vendor/loom/backend`.** Loom's own
 * `backend/Dockerfile` `COPY`s two things from *outside* `backend/`:
 * `agents/strands_agent/src/` and its `requirements.txt` (the comment inline
 * in that Dockerfile — "Agent source for build_agent_artifact
 * (deployment.py resolves via parents[3] -> /)" — is Loom's own backend
 * bundling its low-code agent's source into the same image so it can build
 * that agent's deploy artifact at runtime). A context scoped to
 * `vendor/loom/backend` alone can't see those paths and the build fails;
 * `vendor/loom` (the repo root) plus `dockerfile: "backend/Dockerfile"` is
 * the layout Loom's own `shared/makefile`
 * (`podman build -f ../backend/Dockerfile ..`, run from `shared/`) actually
 * uses. Verified by building this exact Dockerfile/context pair with real
 * `docker build` against a real `v1.6.0` checkout while wiring this up
 * (#20) — the image builds clean.
 *
 * **`dockerfile` is CWD-relative, not context-relative** (chant#928/
 * loomster#35, found live). `DockerBuildInput.dockerfile`'s own docstring
 * says "relative to context", but `@intentius/chant`'s `realDocker.build`
 * (`components/verbs/cloud-executor.ts`) passes it straight through as
 * `docker build -f <dockerfile> <context>` with no join against `context` —
 * Docker CLI itself resolves a relative `-f` against the process's current
 * directory, not the context directory. `chant run` always executes from
 * the project root, so `dockerfile` here is the full project-root-relative
 * path (`vendor/loom/backend/Dockerfile`), not `backend/Dockerfile` alone.
 *
 * **Preset gap note (chant#889 acceptance criterion).** This hand-composes
 * the same Publish -> Apply -> Verify -> Rollback shape
 * `EcsFargateComponent` (`packages/core/src/components/presets/
 * ecs-fargate.ts`, in the `chant` repo) provides, rather than calling the
 * preset directly, because two of its convenience fields carry fixed keys
 * that do not fit Loom's real contract:
 *  1. `sharedAlbStack` always emits exactly `ListenerArn`/`ClusterArn`/
 *     `Subnets` as cross-stack inputs. This stack needs nine inputs across
 *     three stacks (shared-foundation/loom-db/loom-cognito), under
 *     shared-foundation's own real output names (`oEcsClusterArn`,
 *     `oBackendTargetGroupArn`, ...) — none of which match the preset's
 *     fixed set. Covered by wiring every input explicitly through the
 *     generic `inputs` map below instead of `sharedAlbStack`.
 *  2. `imageRef` always targets a CFN Parameter literally named `ImageRef`.
 *     Loom's real template parameter is `pImageUri` (chant#889's settled
 *     decision: preserve Loom's own parameter names for 1:1 fidelity, the
 *     same reasoning `shared-foundation`/`loom-db`/`loom-cognito`'s
 *     `outputs.ts` already apply to output keys). Covered by wiring the
 *     published image through `inputs.pImageUri` instead of `imageRef`.
 * Everything else the preset provides (build -> publish -> apply ->
 * ecs-update-service -> wait-steady-state -> health-gate -> rollback-
 * previous) is exactly this component's own shape — the preset's pipeline
 * fits; only its two fixed-key conveniences don't.
